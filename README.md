# The-Effect-of-BMI-and-Smoking-on-Insurance-Premium

This research is done as my first ever portfolio and as a project submission for my final project in Introduction to Probability Class by Pacmann.ai.
It looks on to how premium of an insurance company gets affected by various variables in the dataset.
My work on answering the research questions was conducted on excel, so the attached excel files is the file that shows how i answer the research questions.
It stil is very very simple but it takes a lot of bravery for me to post this first one. So here you go, cheers!
Note: any comment and advice will be highly appreciated
